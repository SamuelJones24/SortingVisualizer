# SortingVisualizer
Created because I really enjoy algorthims, hopefully this is the first visualization project of many
Currently I have 4 separate sorts, Bubble, Insertion, Quick, and Bogo sort

here is a link to learn more about the algorithims and how they run.

Bubble - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/
Insertion - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/
Quick - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/
Bogo - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bogosort-permutation-sort/
